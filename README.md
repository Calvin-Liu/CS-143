Databases. Coding in SQL and Java
Homework 3 was to create sql queries using an example query given to us about
states, senators, counties, etc.

Project 1,2 and 3 were to create a simple database that could handle actual
queries and print out the trees to them. The database was created in java
using eclipse and then tested out on the command line.
